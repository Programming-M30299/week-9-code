# Code from Week 9

A repository containing the examples from the worksheet.

## Contents

- `collection_examples.py` - A file containing a few functions that use collections.
  Copy the contents of this file into yours and run the functions to see what they do.
- `README.md` - This file.
- `.gitignore` - A file telling git to ignore certain files (e.g. `.pyc` files).
  You do not need to worry about this file for now.
